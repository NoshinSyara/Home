	<h1>Some causes of Global Warming are human activities, like burning fossil fuel which increases the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Another is Solar Irradiance. </h1>
		<p>Scientists link the observed increase in the global  warming trend with  the human influence of the greenhouse effect. 
		Several gases in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain in the atmosphere semi-permanently and do not respond physically or chemically to temperature changes,  forces climate change. Unlike gases, such as water vapour, that respond physically or chemically to temperature changes  is seen as feedback.
		Energy from Earth comes from the Sun after 50% of them filtering through the clouds and air in the Earth's atmosphere. After the remaining energy gets absorbed on the surface, it gets radiated as infrared heat where 90% of this gets absorbed by GreenHouse gasses. Some examples of GreenHouse Gasses are:

		<li>Because it works as a feedback to the climate, water vapour is the most prevalent greenhouse gas. As the Earth's atmosphere warms, water vapour rises, but so does the probability of clouds and precipitation, making these two of the most significant feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.</li>
		<li>Carbon dioxide is emitted by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions as well as by human actions such as deforestation, land use changes, and the use of fossil fuels. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, humans have raised the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by 48%.</li>
		<li>Methane is a hydrocarbon gas that is generated by natural sources as well as human activities such as landfill waste, agriculture, and domestic livestock.</li>
		<li>Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that is generated by soil cultivation methods such as commercial and organic fertilisers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid manufacturing, and biomass combustion.</li>

       			 </a>
		<p>Solar variability has been shown in studies to play a role in historical climate shifts. A reduction in solar activity combined with an increase in volcanic activity, for example, is considered to have contributed to the Little Ice Age, which occurred between about 1650 and 1850, when Greenland cooled from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers expanded in the Alps. Other data, however, indicates that present global warming cannot be explained by variations in solar energy. The average amount of energy emitted by the Sun has either remained steady or grown somewhat since 1750. Scientists would anticipate greater temperatures in all levels of the atmosphere if the warming was driven by a more active Sun.They have instead seen a cooling in the high atmosphere and a warming at the surface and in the lower sections of the atmosphere as a result of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.
