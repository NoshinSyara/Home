	<h1>Effect</h1>
		<p>The average temperature of the Earth climbed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the twentieth century, which is an exceptional occurrence in our planet's recent history. The Earth's climatic record, recorded in ice cores and coral reefs, demonstrates that the global average temperature has remained steady over extended periods of time. Furthermore, tiny changes in temperature cause massive changes in the ecosystem. For example, when the Northeast United States was buried by more than 3,000 feet of ice at the conclusion of the last ice age, average temperatures were just 5 to 9 degrees colder than now.
			Some Global climate change is already having visible effects: glaciers have decreased, sea ice loss has hastened sea level rise, plant and animal ranges have moved, and heat waves have become longer and more powerful. Scientists have decided that global temperatures will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts a 2.5 to 10 degree Fahrenheit temperature rise over the next century, with the consequences on particular regions varying over time as they adapt. Since the 1980s, the frost-free season has been rising across the country, with the greatest increases occurring in the western United States, impacting ecosystems and agriculture.</p>
