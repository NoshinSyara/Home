	<h1>Where Does Climate Change Come From?</h1>
		<p>It is estimated that globally, 50 billion tonnes of CO2 gets emitted into the atmosphere annually. This is 40% higher than emissions in 1990, which was around 35 billion tonnes. Some causes for rising emissions include burning oil, coal, and gas, deforestation, increased livestock farming, fertilizers containing nitrogen, and fluorinated gases. Firstly, burning coal, oil, and gas produce carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Next, deforestation is when trees are cut down and the beneficial effect is lost when the carbon stored in trees is released into the atmosphere. Thirdly, increased livestock farming is when cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their foods. Fourthly, fertilizers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions. Fifthly, fluorinated gases are emitted from equipment and products. Such emissions have a very strong warming effect, up to 23,000 times greater than CO2. Although many other factors add to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions are undoubtedly a leading cause of this crisis.
			    There are many ways you can contribute to reversing the effects of climate change. This includes taking public transportation, walking, biking, not using single-use plastic, recycling, and prioritizing sustainability in your everyday life when possible. You can also focus on climate change when voting for parties that are actively contributing to environmental change.
